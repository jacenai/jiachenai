<span style="font-size: 26px; font-weight: 500;">Clustering on Mice DNA Methylation Aging Pattern</span>

Graduate Student Researcher  | supervised by [Dr. Feng Gao](https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/feng-gao)


- Applied K-means clustering to study methylation profiles across different aging stages in mice (young, midlife, late-life).

Graduate Student Researcher | supervised by [Dr. Matteo Pellegrini](https://medschool.ucla.edu/people/matteo-pellegrini-phd) in his [Lab](https://www.pellegrini.mcdb.ucla.edu/)

- Multivariate linear regression with LOOCV to establish prediction models for associations between DNA methylation CpG sites and cellular signaling pathway with sero-protection after influenza injection at day0 and day28, with considering epigenetic confounders, including age, gender, BMI, and cell types.

Warren Alpert Computational Biology and AI Network Fellow

- Collaborated with faculty on epigenetics data analysis using machine learning and attended workshops on biobanks and AI in biomedical research.

## 2021 – 2023

<span style="font-size: 26px; font-weight: 500;">Statistical Data Analysis for Biology and Biomedicine Research</span>

Undergraduate Research Assistant 

- By multivariate regression in R and found significant correlation between rice yield and irrigation amount in 5 growing stages.
- Via R, performed logistic regression with backward selection and found 3 categorical variables that correlated with semen quality.
- Through deduction and proofs with Markov chains, multivariable calculus and matrices, discussed the recurrence and transience of random walks in three dimensions.

## 2019 – 2020

<span style="font-size: 26px; font-weight: 500;">Lymphocyte Regeneration after Thymocyte Damage in Zebrafish</span>[\[slides\]](assets/LYMPHOCYTE_REGENERATION_AFTER_THYMOCYTE_DAMAGE_IN ZEBRAFISH.pdf)

Volunteer | supervised by [Dr. Li Li](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0064236?language=en)

- Discovered that the Cxcl12b/Cxcr4b chemokine signaling pathway plays a key role in the repair of zebrafish T-lymphocytes by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and then demonstrated the finding using a receptor antagonist, WZ811.
- Detected apoptosis and a significant reduction of thymus lymphocytes through whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and confocal microscopy, in zebrafish treated with 2 mM Metronidazole for 12 hours in vivo.
