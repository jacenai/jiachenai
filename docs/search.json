    "text": "Graduate Student Researcher | Supervised by Dr. Matteo Pellegrini in his Lab\n\nInfluenza vaccination, a prevalent prevention for annually recurring contagious pandemics, elicits immune responses that are possibly induced by DNA methylation. It has been shown that the immune response to influenza vaccination is potentially regulated by DNA methylation on RIG‐I signaling pathway, an important regulator of viral responses, and T cell innate antiviral pathways, within University of Georgia cohorts (UGA3, 4, and 5). This project aims to validate and expand on these findings by integrating multi-omics data from a larger UGA6 cohort to identify the epigenetic factors influencing the immune response to influenza vaccination. We employed multivariate linear regression models with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to investigate associations between DNA methylation profiles and sero-protection levels at day 0 and day 28 post-vaccination, as well as sero-conversion at day 28. Significant CpG sites were mapped to relevant genes and pathways using gene set enrichment analysis tools to identify biological processes involved in the immune response to influenza vaccines. In parallel, similar predictive models were constructed for RNA-seq and cytokine datasets, and the multi-omics data were integrated to identify shared regulatory mechanisms and explore the interplay between DNA methylation, gene expression, and cytokine levels. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic regulation of immune responses to influenza vaccines and identifies potential therapeutic targets, contributing to advancements in precision medicine for influenza vaccination.\n\n\n\n\nGraduate Student Researcher | Supervised by Dr. Feng Gao\n\nWhile general linear epigenetic models, such as Horvath’s aging clock, have been widely established, recent reports indicate that non-linear methylation dynamics predominantly influence nervous system genes and are enriched in bivalently marked chromatin regions. This project aims to identify age-related DNA methylation biomarkers using a non-linear model of male mice colon tissue. By applying k-means based unsupervised hierarchical clustering on CpG methylation matrices, we identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across three aging stages: young, midlife, and late-life. These DMRs are integrated together to form duplicated methylation profiles for each age group, and then put into neural network to further characterize age-related biomarkers. The findings will enhance our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms driving aging and contribute to the broader understanding of age-associated methylation patterns.\n\n\n\n\nWarren Alpert Fellow | Supervised by Dr. Vanessa D Jonsson\n\nThis project leverages SARS-CoV2 RNA-seq data to infer immune histories by integrating multi-omics analyses. The pipeline uses immune cell deconvolution (CIBERSORT) and metagenomics to estimate immune cell proportions and microbial protein landscapes from nasal swap RNA source. It employs tools like TRUST4 for BCR/TCR repertoire analysis and pvacseq for neoantigen prediction, incorporating HLA typing and peptide-MHC binding affinity assessments. And finally, we will compare the immune histories inferred from the RNA-seq data with publicly available SARS-CoV2 antibodies and nanobodies data to validate the pipeline. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive view of immune memory and response, informing personalized treatment and vaccine strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Research Assistant\n\nUsing stochastic process theory, I modeled random walks as time-homogeneous Markov chains and analyzed their recurrent and transient properties by reviewing relevant derivations and proofs, which are essential for understanding gene expression and protein interactions that involve stochastic behavior.\nBy multivariate regression in R and found significant correlation between rice yield and irrigation amount in 5 growing stages.\nVia R, performed logistic regression and found 3 categorical variables that correlated with semen quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review examined the impact of dietary habits, BMI, alcohol, smoking, stress, mobile phone usage, and microplastics on sperm parameters. It highlighted that a balanced diet, exercise, and stress management improve semen quality, while smoking, alcohol, and microplastic exposure impair it. Statistical models like multivariate regression and meta-analysis were used to assess fertility impacts, emphasizing the public health importance of addressing these lifestyle factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteer | Supervised by Dr. Li Li\n\nThymus atrophy and T lymphocyte deficiencies are common in aging and following damage caused by factors such as radiation, chemotherapy, or bacterial infections, leading to impaired immune function. Our study investigates the regeneration of T lymphocytes in zebrafish after thymocyte injury, leveraging the transparency and genetic tractability of zebrafish as a model organism. A damage model was constructed by treating Tg(coro1a:Dendra2-NTR) transgenic zebrafish with 2 mM Metronidazole for 12 hours, resulting in significant lymphocyte reduction and apoptosis in the thymus, as confirmed by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and confocal microscopy.\nThrough real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), we discovered that the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling pathway plays a critical role in the regeneration of thymic lymphocytes. Inhibition of this pathway with WZ811, a CXCL12/CXCR4 receptor antagonist, significantly impaired lymphocyte recovery, suggesting that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling is essential for lymphocyte regeneration. Additionally, lineage tracing experiments revealed that most regenerating lymphocytes originated from hematopoietic stem cells migrating from the kidney to the thymus. These findings highlight the importance of the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway in lymphocyte regeneration and offer insights into the mechanisms of immune recovery after thymocyte damage."
