# About Me

I'm a UCLA grad student exploring the exciting fields of biostatistics, computational biology, and epigenetics while pursuing my MS in Biostatistics at the [Fielding School of Public Health](https://ph.ucla.edu/). My [research](research.qmd) explores gene expression patterns across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels, using statistical models to uncover biomarkers, elaborate biological mechanisms, and build predictive models related to aging, vaccines, and diseases, especially in the context of epigenetic regulation.

I'm passionate about mathematical and statistical methods for genetic analysis to push the boundaries of epigenetic research and contribute to the future of vaccine development and precision medicine!



# Research Interests

1)  **Epigenetics**: Investigating dynamics of quintessential epigenomic biomarkers during lifespan. Studying the impact of DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA on gene expression regulation and cellular signaling pathways.
2)  **Statistical Genetics**: Modeling gene expression patterns across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels by linear or nonlinear methods and identifying biomarkers to build predictive models related to age, vaccines, and chronic diseases.
3)  **Bioinformatics**: Developing computational tools to map CpG sites to methylation patterns and optimizing algorithms for efficiently digging into high-throughput sequencing data purposes.



# Highlights


-  [**Influenza Vaccination Impact on DNA Methylation in UGA6 Cohort**](https://jacenai.github.io/jiachenai//research.html#influenza-vaccination-impact-on-dna-methylation-in-uga6-cohort): Identified key epigenetic regulators of immune responses to influenza vaccination in a large cohort study, uncovering the RIG‚ÄêI signaling pathway's role in vaccine-induced immunity through integrated DNA methylation, RNA-seq, and cytokine analyses.


-  [**Nonlinear Aging Dynamics in Co-methylation Network**](https://jacenai.github.io/jiachenai//research.html#nonlinear-aging-dynamics-in-co-methylation-network): Unveiled the critical role of non-linear co-methylation dynamics in aging by mapping epigenetic changes to gene networks and biological pathways, providing novel insights into age-related processes beyond linear models.

- [**Inferring immune histories from SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq data**](https://jacenai.github.io/jiachenai//research.html#inferring-immune-histories-from-sars-cov-2-rna-seq-data): Developed a pipeline to infer immune histories from SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq data, linking immune profiling to personalized responses.


-  [**Lymphocyte Regeneration after Thymocyte Damage in Zebrafish**](https://jacenai.github.io/jiachenai//research.html#lymphocyte-regeneration-after-thymocyte-damage-in-zebrafish-presentation-slides): Uncovered the pivotal role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway in thymic lymphocyte regeneration, revealing stem cell migration as a key mechanism for immune recovery.
