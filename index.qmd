# About Me

I'm a UCLA grad student exploring the exciting fields of biostatistics, computational biology, and epigenetics while pursuing my MS in Biostatistics at the [Fielding School of Public Health](https://ph.ucla.edu/). My [research](research.qmd) explores gene expression patterns across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels, using statistical models to uncover biomarkers, elaborate biological mechanisms, and build predictive models related to aging, vaccines, and diseases, especially in the context of epigenetic regulation.

I'm passionate about mathematical and statistical methods for genetic analysis to push the boundaries of epigenetic research and contribute to the future of vaccine development and precision medicine!



# Research Interests

1)  **Epigenetics**: Investigating dynamics of quintessential epigenomic biomarkers during lifespan. Studying the impact of DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA on gene expression regulation and cellular signaling pathways.
2)  **Statistical Genetics**: Modeling gene expression patterns across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels by linear or nonlinear methods and identifying biomarkers to build predictive models related to age, vaccines, and chronic diseases.
3)  **Bioinformatics**: Developing computational tools to map CpG sites to methylation patterns and optimizing algorithms for efficiently digging into high-throughput sequencing data purposes.



# Featured Projects


-  [**Epigenetic Regulation of Immune Response to Influenza Vaccination: A Multi-Omics Analysis in the UGA6 Cohort**](https://jacenai.github.io/jiachenai/research.html#epigenetic-regulation-of-immune-response-to-influenza-vaccination-a-multi-omics-analysis-in-the-uga6-cohort): Revealed the role of DNA methylation in regulating immune responses to influenza vaccination, identifying key CpG sites and the signaling pathway as potential therapeutic targets, and integrated multi-omics data to validate epigenetic influences on immune regulation.


-  [**DNA Methylation Biomarkers of Aging in Male Mice Colon from Non-Linear Models**](https://jacenai.github.io/jiachenai//research.html#dna-methylation-biomarkers-of-aging-in-male-mice-colon-from-non-linear-models): Identified age-related DNA methylation biomarkers in male mice colon tissue using non-linear models and k-means clustering, followed by neural network analysis of differentially methylated regions across aging stages, to enhance the understanding of epigenetic mechanisms driving aging.

- [**Inferring immune histories from SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq data**](https://jacenai.github.io/jiachenai/research.html#inferring-immune-histories-from-sars-cov-2-rna-seq-data): Utilized SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq data combined with multi-omics approaches, incorporating immune cell deconvolution, BCR/TCR repertoire profiling, and neoantigen prediction, to infer immune histories and validate the pipeline against publicly available SARS-CoV-2 antibody datasets.


-  [**Lymphocyte Regeneration after Thymocyte Damage in Zebrafish**](https://jacenai.github.io/jiachenai/research.html#lymphocyte-regeneration-after-thymocyte-damage-in-zebrafish-presentation-slides): Demonstrated that the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling pathway is essential for T lymphocyte regeneration post-thymocyte injury, with most regenerating cells traced back to hematopoietic stem cells migrating from the kidney to the thymus.
